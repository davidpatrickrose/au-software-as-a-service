## Planned interruption

It's often necessary for services to be interrupted so that they can be updated or improved in some way.  Service users need to know how this kind of interruption will be managed.

### Planned Service interruption will take place after a written warning.

Contractor may interrupt the provision of the Services with {{interruption warning}} days notice.

## Unplanned interruption

Even services that are perfectly maintained can have unanticipated problems (especially in the world of software).

Generally, the more critical that a service is to a customer, the higher the performance threshold needs to be.  The second option is usually the right one to choose if the Service is essential to the Customer (and expensive).

### The Service will be available to a reasonable extent.

- Customer acknowledges that:
  - interruptions as a result of third party suppliers to the Contractor are beyond the control of hte Contractor; and
  - the Services may be occasionally interrupted on account of technical difficulties.
- Contractor will use its reasonable efforts to remedy interruptions to the Services as soon as is reasonably practicable.

### Compensation for interruptions to the Services will be governed by an SLA.

Contractor will compensate the Customer for interruptions to the Service in accordance with the SLA at {{sla url}}.

## Data Rights

### Data Obligations

- International Storage of Data - do we just say that Customer grants Contractor the right to store data internationally?

- Data remains property of Customer. Customer grants contractor a license to do anything with the data it needs to in order to meet it's obligations under the agreement

- PAT: Do we actually just use the license module for the above?

- Customer indemnifies Contractor against any claim by any third party that the Data infringes on the rights of that third party (IP rights, privacy rights, etc, etc)


- PATXXX: Yes, the above item should be handled by the indemnity module. Once we have the ability to ovveride the default guidance I'll implement the above. Or is the above handled by the language in the posted information module?

## Backups

The Customer may want the Contractor to ensure that their Data is backed up in multiple locations or formats. However, this may lie outside the scope of the Service offered by Contractor.

### Contractor does not back up Data for the customer

Contractor does not offer backups of Data as a component of the Service. Responsibility for Data loss lies with the Customer.

### Contractor does back up Data

Contractor performs backups of Data every {{backup period}}. Contractor does not accept responsibility for data loss that occurs between these backups.

## Warranties
### Contractor warrants they possess neccesary IP rights

PATXXX - This is to serve the same purpose as the indemity we talked about. Skips two indemnities in the document.

Contractor promises that it posseses all third party intellectual property rights neccesary to supply the Service to the Customer.

Warranties are limited to those explicitly described in the agreement. No implied warrenties exist including fitness for a particular purpose.
